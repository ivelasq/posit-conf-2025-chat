Causal Inference in R,"## Session Title: Causal Inference in R

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sep 16 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Grand Hall East D

**Session Info:**  
In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.  
  
In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  
  
This workshop is for you if you:  
know how to fit a linear regression model in R,  
have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  
are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships."

**Location:** Chicago D

**Session Info:**  
Data insights won’t speak for themselves.  
  
For the past five years, Articulation has been coaching all of the breakout session, keynote, and lightning talk speakers at posit::conf. We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  
  
This workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  
  
The Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  
What you’ll learn:  
What data to gather about your audience  
A formula for setting the necessary context  
A formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  
Strategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  
Strategies for laddering complex insights"
Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases,"## Session Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sep 16 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Hanover A

**Session Info:**  
The deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  
  
Our session will address the following key questions and themes:  
Actionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  
Industry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  
Selecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  
Pharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  
Does this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  
Compliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  
Provisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?"

Package Development: The Rest of the Owl,"## Session Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sep 16 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Grand Hall East B

**Session Info:**  
In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data. Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  
  
This workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of ""How to draw an owl"", you've definitely drawn some circles.  
  
But now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!  
  
You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  
  
This list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  
Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  
Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  
Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. ""later"")  
Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  
Data: internal data vs. data available to your user  
GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  
User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  
Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  
Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  
Have concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  
Are interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  
Are at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day."
Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python,"## Session Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sep 16 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Regency VII

**Session Info:**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago. But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.  
  
We’ll introduce you to ellmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.  
  
Along the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.  
  
You’ll discover that:  
Calling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.  
It’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.  
It’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life."
R in Production,"## Session Title: R in Production

**Date/Time:** Tuesday, Sep 16 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EDT  
**Location:** Regency VI

**Session Info:**  
What it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  
  
This workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  
Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  
Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  
Not just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  
Get frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  
Struggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  
Want to improve the quality of your production code generally."

LIVE DEMO: Building Agentic AI applications with Positron and AWS Strands Agents,"## Session Title: LIVE DEMO: Building Agentic AI applications with Positron and AWS Strands Agents

**Date/Time:** Thursday, Sep 18 8:00 AM - 8:15 AM EDT  
**Location:** The Learning Center

**Session Info:**  
AWS Strands Agents is an open source SDK that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents in just a few lines of code. Strands scales from simple to complex agent use cases, and from local development to deployment in production. Streamlit is a popular and straightforward option for quickly turning data analysis into shareable, interactive applications. And when you combine Streamlit with Positron, Posit’s newly designed IDE with data analysis and multi-language development in mind, provides a unified, purpose-built environment for data scientists to develop their application in a streamlined fashion. In this session, we are going to use Positron as our IDE. Within Positron, we will show how developers and data scientists can easily use AWS strands Agents to build an agentic AI Streamlit application."

The Psychology of Technologists,"## Session Title: The Psychology of Technologists

**Date/Time:** Thursday, Sep 18 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM EDT  
**Location:** Centennial Ballroom

**Session Info:**  
Technology teams are struggling to be heard. Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human."

Lunch & Learn: Hosted by Jumping Rivers | How to convince IT that an R package is “safe”,"## Session Title: Lunch & Learn: Hosted by Jumping Rivers | How to convince IT that an R package is “safe”

**Date/Time:** Thursday, Sep 18 11:45 AM - 12:45 PM EDT  
**Location:** Hanover AB

**Session Info:**  
Safe is a great word. It sounds so precise and clear, but a little thought makes it clear that “safe” is open to interpretation. So what does it mean to say a package is “safe”?  
  
The key to this is to define your risk appetite. If you are in a GxP-compliant environment, not only should everything be carefully assessed, it also needs to be auditable.  
  
While government departments and non-regulated environments have a greater risk appetite, they still need to consider (and convince IT!) that the packages they use are sensible.  
  
In this session, we’ll discuss package risk and how we can make informed decisions on whether to use a package in production. We’ll discuss practical ways of assessing R packages and how this feeds into GxP-compliant and other environments.  
  
Do you have a package you want us to assess? Let us know, and we’ll present the results at the lunch and learn."

Trustworthy Data Visualization,"## Session Title: Trustworthy Data Visualization

**Date/Time:** Thursday, Sep 18 4:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT

**Session Info:**  
Visualizations are the most widespread, the most immediately accessible, and in some ways the most authoritative-looking way to present results to audiences, including when the audience is just yourself. In this talk I ask: what makes a visualization trustworthy? How do tools like R and ggplot to help us achieve that goal? And what are their limits, especially now that it's easier than it has ever been to do untrustworthy things with data?"
