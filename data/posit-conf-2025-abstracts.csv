## Title: Web applications with Shiny and React (and AI)
**Code:** PAR-021
**Session type:** Breakout Session

**Abstract:**
If you've ever wanted to have complete control over the UI for a Shiny application, this talk might be for you. In this talk I'll show how to integrate a back end written in Shiny (for R or Python) with a front end written in React.js. This lets you combine Shiny's reactivity with the flexibility of the React web development ecosystem. <br>

## Title: Making Things Nice in Python
**Code:** PAR-022
**Session type:** Breakout Session

**Abstract:**
When working on the Great Tables and Pointblank Python packages, we've tried to make them 'nice'. These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.
<br><br>
However, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.

We'll talk about how those same principles have guided the development of Positron, a new data science environment from Posit, and how you can apply them to your own tool-building work.

Keynote,Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science,"## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science
**Code:** KEY-0004
**Session type:** Keynote

**Abstract:**
This presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies. We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.

Keynote,The Psychology of Technologists,"## Title: The Psychology of Technologists 
**Code:** KEY-0003
**Session type:** Keynote

**Abstract:**
Technology teams are struggling to be heard. Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.

<br><br>
Talks included in this session:
<br><br>
<b> Deploy with Confidence: Strategies to Minimize Failure and Maximize Success (on Posit Connect) </b> <br>Ryszard Szymański
<br><br>
Release day has arrived - you’re eager to share the latest version of your app with users. You deploy it, ready to celebrate…
<br><br>
Then everything breaks. The app won’t load, and the errors make no sense. Despite all your efforts - testing locally, verifying in staging - production still surprises you.
<br><br>
Deployments are tricky, full of hidden challenges that can derail even the best preparations.  But with the right strategies, you can reduce risk and increase the likelihood of a successful release
<br><br>
In this talk, we’ll explore deployment techniques such as blue/green deployments and feature flags, showing how they can be applied when working with Posit Connect. You’ll also learn what to do when the unexpected happens.
<br><br><br>

<b> Building Web Apps and APIs in R with Ambiorix </b> <br>Kennedy Mwavu & John Coene

<b> From messy to meaningful data: LLM-powered classification in R </b>  <br>Dylan Pieper
<br><br>
Transform messy, unstructured data into meaningful, structured data using ellmer, Posit's R package for interacting with large language models (LLMs). LLMs can quickly convert thousands of texts, PDFs, and images into the data you need for your analysis. This talk demonstrates the practical benefits and addresses the common pitfalls of using LLMs through three examples: classifying images of Iris flowers and text descriptions of disease symptoms and crimes. Learn structured outputs, prompting strategies, model accuracy and confidence measurements, and validation techniques that blend generative AI with traditional ML concepts. Perfect for both AI-curious beginners and experienced data scientists.
<br><br><br>

<b> Who are 'the ggplot2 extenders' and how to become one </b> <br>Evangeline 'Gina' Reynolds

Workshop,Causal Inference in R,"## Title: Causal Inference in R
**Code:** WS-013
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.
<br> <br>
In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.
<br><br>
This workshop is for you if you:
<ul>
<li> know how to fit a linear regression model in R, </li>
<li> have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and </li>
<li> are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships. </li>

Workshop,Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases,"## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases
**Code:** WS-015
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
The deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research. This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings. 
<br><br>
Our session will address the following key questions and themes:
<ul>
<li> Actionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses. </li>
<li> Industry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes. </li>
<li> Selecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses. </li>
<li> Pharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking. </li>
<li> Does this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences? </li>
<li> Compliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation. </li>
<li> Provisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots? </li>
</ul>
<br>
The workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.
<br><br>
Join us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.

Workshop,Package Development: The Rest of the Owl,"## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl
**Code:** WS-006
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.
Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>
This workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.
In terms of ""How to draw an owl"", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>
But now it's time to draw the <a href=""https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg""><b><u>rest of the owl</u></b></a>!
<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.
We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.
<br><br>
This list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:
<ul>
<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`</li>
<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments</li>
<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. ""later"")</li>
<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website</li>
<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user</li>
<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website</li>
<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package</li>
</ul>
There will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>
We will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>
But if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.
<br><br>
This will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.
<br><br>
This course is for you if you:
<ul>
<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.</li>
<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=""https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html""><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages</u></b></a> or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in <u><a href=""https://r-pkgs.org/package-within.html""><b><u>The package within</u></b></a> chapter.</u></u></li>
<li>   Have concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.</li>
<li>   Are interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.</li>
<li>   Are at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
We expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.<br>
We typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.<br>
Participants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.<br><br><br>

Workshop,Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python,"## Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python
**Code:** WS-003
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
Large Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago. But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.
<br><br>
We’ll introduce you to ellmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.
<br><br>
Along the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.
<br><br>
You’ll discover that:
<ul>
<li> Calling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.</li>
<li> It’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.</li>
<li> It’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.</li>
</ul>
This workshop is perfect for those curious about AI but unsure where to start, as well as for seasoned developers looking to learn about Posit’s new tools. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool calling. You’ll get hands-on experience with guided projects or with the flexibility to explore using your own projects.
<br><br>
If you’ve been sitting on the fence, wondering whether LLMs are worth diving into, this workshop will give you the hands-on experience and confidence you need to get started.

Workshop,R in Production,"## Title: R in Production
**Code:** WS-001
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
What it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.
<br><br>
This workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:
<ul>
<li> Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?</li>
<li> Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.</li>
<li> Not just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?</li>
</ul>
<br>
This course is for you if you:
<ul>
<li> Get frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.</li>
<li> Struggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.</li>
<li> Want to improve the quality of your production code generally.</li>
</ul>

Workshop,Shiny for Python,"## Title: Shiny for Python
**Code:** WS-017
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
Shiny is a framework for building web applications and data dashboards in Python. In this one-day intermediary workshop, you will see how the basic building blocks of Shiny can be extended to create your own scalable, production-ready Python applications.
<br><br>
In particular, this workshop covers:
<ul>
<li> Overview of the basic building blocks of a Shiny for Python application </li>
<li> How to refactor applications into shiny modules </li>
<li> How to write tests for your shiny application </li>
</ul>
<br>
At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li> Build a Shiny app in Python </li>
<li> Refactor your reactive logic into Shiny Modules </li>
<li> Identify when to write Shiny modules </li>
<li> Write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your shiny application </li>
</ul>
<br>
1. What if I'm a complete beginner?
<br><br>
You should have a basic understanding of Python and be able to install packages with pip, do basic data manipulation, and draw plots.
<br><br>
2. What if I've never built a Shiny app before?
<br><br>
This workshop doesn’t require any Shiny or web application experience. We'll focus more on practical examples in the course. We do have additional resources for you to dive more into more Shiny details, but we will cover the basics needed to build larger and scalable applications.
<br><br>
3. Why should I learn Shiny if I already know Streamlit or Dash?
<br><br>
We believe that Shiny is the best framework for building data applications in Python. Its reactive execution model means that you can build performant applications without
explicitly caching data or managing the application state. See <a href=""https://posit.co/blog/why-shiny-for-python""><b><u>this blog post</u></b></a> for more on why we think that Shiny is worth learning.
<br><br>
4. I’m an expert with Shiny for R, is this workshop for me?
<br><br>
The R and Python Shiny packages are similar, so some of the content in this workshop may be familiar to you. That said, it’s a great opportunity to fill in missing pieces and ask questions about Python best practices. We will also talk about Shiny modules and testing in this workshop, which will also be a precursor for you to learn more about Python Packaging. If you are interested in learning more about Python, this workshop would be a great practical way to learn how to code in Python. Check out our <a href=""https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/comp-r-shiny.html""><b><u>quickstart guide for R users</u></b></a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXidQWYY14w&ab_channel=DataUmbrella""><b><u>this tutorial</u></b></a> if you want to get up to speed with Shiny for Python quickly.

Workshop,Shiny for R,"## Title: Shiny for R
**Code:** WS-011
**Session type:** Workshop

**Abstract:**
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. This workshop will start at the beginning: designing and implementing user interfaces, learning and understanding the reactive programming model, and deploying your Shiny apps publicly and privately. This year, we will also introduce the use of the bslib package to modernize your apps' layouts and components. The workshop will also include several intermediate-level topics like debugging and modularizing your apps and implementing dynamic user interfaces. In the end, attendees should be confident Shiny users, able to design interactive apps to achieve their purpose and produce a polished and professional implementation.
