Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.\n\n---\n\n## Title: The Psychology of Technologists \n**Code:** KEY-0003\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nTechnology teams are struggling to be heard.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry.

With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** Director of Training and Community\n**Company:** Fred Hutch Cancer Center\n**Bio:**\nI am the Director of Training and Community at the Data Science Lab at Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Over 12 years of teaching, I’ve trained learners in many topics, including Machine Learning, the DNAnexus cloud-based genomics platform, Python, R and the Tidyverse, and Shiny. I am passionate about helping learners learn in a safe environment.\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit + Duke University\n**Bio:**\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Professor of the Practice and the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit, PBC.

We developed a framework that acknowledges the time and expertise invested in data preparation and maximizes its value. Our data-as-a-product suite of R packages promotes joint code and data version control, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R package versioning, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming. I'm excited to share my experience onboarding collaborators to this reproducible research framework, highlighting key challenges and lessons learned from advocating for good development practices in a dynamic research environment.\n\n**Speaker name:** Clara Amorosi\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Bristol Myers Squibb\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Ripples of Change with R: It’s more than just coding\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSwitching from SAS to R is not just a technical shift – it requires a whole new way of thinking! This journey of moving a SAS-centered coding team to R was filled with strategies, challenges, and unexpected roadblocks.

Given this ambitious timeline, someone might ask, \"How is the open-source adoption going?\" This seemingly simple question involves complexities: What metrics do you track? How to measure success? How to show progress? GSK addressed these by leveraging our internal GitHub data, using open-source R packages like {gh}, scheduling our data pipeline on Posit Connect, and generating diverse reports/dashboards. We’ll share our journey of transitioning to R and other open-source tools, offering insights on scaling full enterprise open-source adoption.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ben Arancibia\n**Job title:** Director Data Science - Scientific and Adoption Lead for Open Source\n**Company:** GSK\n**Bio:**\nBen Arancibia is a Director of Data Science on GSK's Data Science Innovation and Engineering Team.

We started 3 years ago, and over that time we have migrated 700,000+ lines of code, navigating waves of change while adapting to new IT environments and workflows. Challenges like technical barriers, workload balancing, and resistance to change were tackled through training, mentorship, and executive support. More than tools, this shift transforms our culture—turning siloed developers into fearless swimmers. Success requires training, teamwork, and courage. Organizations making a similar leap should start small, invest in training, and stay adaptable to stay afloat.\n\n**Speaker name:** Katerina Gapanenko\n**Job title:** Manager, Advanced Analytics\n**Company:** Canadian Institute for Health Information\n**Bio:**\nDr. Katerina Gapanenko is Manager of Analytic Techniques and Tools at CIHI and affiliated with the University of Toronto’s Master of Health Informatics program.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.\n\n**Speaker name:** Libby McKenna\n**Job title:** Water Process Engineer\n**Company:** Brown and Caldwell\n**Bio:**\nLibby is an environmental engineer at Brown and Caldwell in Denver, CO.

They run on every save, on every pull request, and in git pre-commit hooks to ensure code consistently looks its best at all times.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, you'll learn about Air, a new R code formatter. Air is extremely fast, capable of formatting individual files so fast that you'll question if its even running, and of formatting entire projects in under a second. Air integrates directly with your favorite IDEs, like Positron, RStudio, and VS Code, and is available on the command line, making it easy to standardize on one tool even for teams using various IDEs.\n<br><br>\nOnce you start using Air, you'll never worry about code style ever again!\n\n**Speaker name:** Davis Vaughan\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nDavis is a software engineer at Posit working on improving various aspects of the tidyverse - from high level packages like dplyr and tidyr, to lower level ones like vctrs.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Open Source\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence.

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.\n\n---\n\n## Title: The Psychology of Technologists \n**Code:** KEY-0003\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nTechnology teams are struggling to be heard.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python.

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Open Source\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.\n\n---\n\n## Title: The Psychology of Technologists \n**Code:** KEY-0003\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nTechnology teams are struggling to be heard.

Given this ambitious timeline, someone might ask, \"How is the open-source adoption going?\" This seemingly simple question involves complexities: What metrics do you track? How to measure success? How to show progress? GSK addressed these by leveraging our internal GitHub data, using open-source R packages like {gh}, scheduling our data pipeline on Posit Connect, and generating diverse reports/dashboards. We’ll share our journey of transitioning to R and other open-source tools, offering insights on scaling full enterprise open-source adoption.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ben Arancibia\n**Job title:** Director Data Science - Scientific and Adoption Lead for Open Source\n**Company:** GSK\n**Bio:**\nBen Arancibia is a Director of Data Science on GSK's Data Science Innovation and Engineering Team.

We started 3 years ago, and over that time we have migrated 700,000+ lines of code, navigating waves of change while adapting to new IT environments and workflows. Challenges like technical barriers, workload balancing, and resistance to change were tackled through training, mentorship, and executive support. More than tools, this shift transforms our culture—turning siloed developers into fearless swimmers. Success requires training, teamwork, and courage. Organizations making a similar leap should start small, invest in training, and stay adaptable to stay afloat.\n\n**Speaker name:** Katerina Gapanenko\n**Job title:** Manager, Advanced Analytics\n**Company:** Canadian Institute for Health Information\n**Bio:**\nDr. Katerina Gapanenko is Manager of Analytic Techniques and Tools at CIHI and affiliated with the University of Toronto’s Master of Health Informatics program.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.\n\n**Speaker name:** Libby McKenna\n**Job title:** Water Process Engineer\n**Company:** Brown and Caldwell\n**Bio:**\nLibby is an environmental engineer at Brown and Caldwell in Denver, CO.

They run on every save, on every pull request, and in git pre-commit hooks to ensure code consistently looks its best at all times.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, you'll learn about Air, a new R code formatter. Air is extremely fast, capable of formatting individual files so fast that you'll question if its even running, and of formatting entire projects in under a second. Air integrates directly with your favorite IDEs, like Positron, RStudio, and VS Code, and is available on the command line, making it easy to standardize on one tool even for teams using various IDEs.\n<br><br>\nOnce you start using Air, you'll never worry about code style ever again!\n\n**Speaker name:** Davis Vaughan\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nDavis is a software engineer at Posit working on improving various aspects of the tidyverse - from high level packages like dplyr and tidyr, to lower level ones like vctrs.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Open Source\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.\n\n---\n\n## Title: The Psychology of Technologists \n**Code:** KEY-0003\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nTechnology teams are struggling to be heard.

We developed a framework that acknowledges the time and expertise invested in data preparation and maximizes its value. Our data-as-a-product suite of R packages promotes joint code and data version control, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R package versioning, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming. I'm excited to share my experience onboarding collaborators to this reproducible research framework, highlighting key challenges and lessons learned from advocating for good development practices in a dynamic research environment.\n\n**Speaker name:** Clara Amorosi\n**Job title:** Principal Data Scientist\n**Company:** Bristol Myers Squibb\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Ripples of Change with R: It’s more than just coding\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSwitching from SAS to R is not just a technical shift – it requires a whole new way of thinking! This journey of moving a SAS-centered coding team to R was filled with strategies, challenges, and unexpected roadblocks. Change can be frustrating, but with the right mindset and approach, it becomes an opportunity for growth and empowerment. As a forward-thinking R strategist and advocate for growth, I am excited to help you discover practical strategies to ease the transition, overcome resistance and frustration, and empower teams to embrace R with confidence. Whether you team is starting on a similar path or is struggling, I will share insights on how to navigate challenges, avoid pitfalls, and hopefully leave you with a roadmap for success.\n\n**Speaker name:** Yvonne Kienast\n**Job title:** Project Lead\n**Company:** Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: What R We Counting?\n**Code:** PAR-011\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nGSK Biostatistics mandates that all new tools be written using open-source languages and open-source code achieve parity with proprietary software by the end of 2025. Given this ambitious timeline, someone might ask, \"How is the open-source adoption going?\" This seemingly simple question involves complexities: What metrics do you track? How to measure success? How to show progress? GSK addressed these by leveraging our internal GitHub data, using open-source R packages like {gh}, scheduling our data pipeline on Posit Connect, and generating diverse reports/dashboards. We’ll share our journey of transitioning to R and other open-source tools, offering insights on scaling full enterprise open-source adoption.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ben Arancibia\n**Job title:** Director Data Science - Scientific and Adoption Lead for Open Source\n**Company:** GSK\n**Bio:**\nBen Arancibia is a Director of Data Science on GSK's Data Science Innovation and Engineering Team.

It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency.

These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.\n<br><br>\nHowever, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rich Ianonne\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nRich is a software engineer that enjoys working with R and Python. He likes to create packages that help people to accomplish things. While Rich very clearly digs software development activities, he enjoys other things as well!

When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.\n<br><br>\nSoftware documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.\n\n**Speaker name:** Michael Chow\n**Job title:** Software Engineer, Open Source\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nMichael Chow.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience.

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.

You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.\n<br><br>\nThis workshop is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li> know how to fit a linear regression model in R, <\/li>\n<li> have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and <\/li>\n<li> are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n**Speaker name:** Malcolm Barrett\n**Job title:** Research Software Engineer\n**Company:** Stanford University\n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://malco.io/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Malcolm Barrett<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\"> is an epidemiologist and research software engineer at Stanford University.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n**Code:** KEY-0004\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

In this talk I ask: what makes a visualization trustworthy? How do tools like R and ggplot to help us achieve that goal? And what are their limits, especially now that it's easier than it has ever been to do untrustworthy things with data?\n\n---\n\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Facepalm-driven Development: Learning From AI and Human Errors\n\n**Date/Time:** Thursday, Sep 18 1:00 PM - 2:20 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial I\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\nNA\n\n---\n\n## Session Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n\n**Date/Time:** Wednesday, Sep 17 4:15 PM - 5:15 PM EDT  \n**Location:** Centennial Ballroom\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies. We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n**Code:** KEY-0004\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies.

How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n**Code:** KEY-0004\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies.

We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n**Code:** KEY-0004\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025.

I am passionate about helping learners learn in a safe environment.\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users. Finally, I will touch on incorporating this tool into low-stakes assessment and ethical considerations for the formal assessment structure of the course relying on LLMs.\n\n**Speaker name:** Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel\n**Job title:** Professor + Developer Educator\n**Company:** Posit + Duke University\n**Bio:**\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Professor of the Practice and the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit, PBC.

But for many, the idea of integrating LLM APIs into their workflows feels daunting. This workshop is here to show you otherwise.  \n  \nWe’ll introduce you to ellmer (R) and chatlas (Python), two user-friendly packages developed by Posit that make calling LLMs from code surprisingly straightforward. These tools handle the complexities of conversation history, tool calling, vision support, and more, so you can focus on experimentation and creativity. They also integrate nicely with Shiny for R and Python, where you can easily create chat interfaces or build custom web apps around LLM workflows.  \n  \nAlong the way, we’ll explore system prompt design, token management, tool calling, and structured output, all while building familiarity with the various models and vendors that are shaping the AI landscape today.  \n  \nYou’ll discover that:  \nCalling LLMs from code unlocks new possibilities that go far beyond what’s achievable with off-the-shelf tools like ChatGPT.  \nIt’s easier than you think—no advanced AI background required.  \nIt’s incredibly fun and rewarding to bring your own ideas to life.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python\n**Code:** WS-003\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) open up a world of programmatic possibilities, giving developers easy access to capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

              "response": "The submission provides the Welcome Reception date and time as Tuesday, Sep 16, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM EDT, which matches the criterion exactly. \n\nFor the Evening Event at the Georgia Aquarium, the submission lists it as Wednesday, Sep 17, 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM EDT, while the criterion states 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM EDT. The submission's timing extends one hour later than the criterion, which is a minor discrepancy but still relevant to note.\n\nThe Community Mixer Happy Hour is mentioned in both the submission and the criterion, though the criterion does not specify the time or location for this event. The submission states it is on Thursday, Sep 18, 5:15 PM - 6:15 PM EDT at Hanover AB.\n\nOverall, the submission mostly aligns with the criterion, with a slight difference in the end time of the Evening Event at the Georgia Aquarium. This difference is small and does not fundamentally change the event's identity or timing significantly.\n\nTherefore, the submission meets the criterion sufficiently.\n\nGRADE: C",

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving.

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines.

In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human. \n\n**Speaker name:** Cat Hicks\n**Job title:** Psychologist for Software Teams\n**Company:** Catharsis Consulting\n**Bio:**\nCat Hicks is a psychologist for software teams and defender of the mismeasured. She is the author of the Developer Thriving framework, the AI Skill Threat framework, and the VP of Research at Pluralsight. Cat is the founder of the Developer Success Lab, an open science research lab that creates industry-changing empirical evidence about how organizations and individuals can achieve sustainable, resilient innovation in technology and create more wellbeing for technologists.

Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.\n\n---\n\n## Title: The Psychology of Technologists \n**Code:** KEY-0003\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nTechnology teams are struggling to be heard.

We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science\n**Code:** KEY-0004\n**Session type:** Keynote\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies.

For that, we have implemented a ‘layout-as-code’ system where each user can have its own layout of pages and modules, stored as json in the database. Users have the option to drag and drop modules to different locations or change the layout altogether, adding and removing modules as needed! \n<br>For developers, this system of loosely coupled modules helps to quickly contribute to the project as a new module needs only a couple of lines of code to integrate it within the framework.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kim Schouten\n**Job title:** Data scientist\n**Company:** Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit (Dutch Healthcare Authority)\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: shinyGovStyle - accessible government design in RShiny\n**Code:** PAR-020\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn the UK, we are required to make public sector websites accessible to all users. While there is a wealth of UK government data is publicly available, it can be tough to engage with. Government analysts are increasingly turning to R Shiny aim to enhance their data dissemination, making it more engaging for users, but how can they do this consistently and in a way that carries the same trustworthiness and authority as a domain such as GOV.UK? Enter shinyGovstyle, a package crafted by UK government analysts that seamlessly incorporates GOV.UK's frontend design components into shiny functions, allowing R users to effortlessly add them to their apps, emulating the design of other GOV.UK services and saving hours of development time.\n\n**Speaker name:** Cam Race\n**Job title:** Lead Product Manager and Statistician\n**Company:** Department for Education (UK)\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: shinyGovStyle - accessible government design in RShiny\n**Code:** PAR-020\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn the UK, we are required to make public sector websites accessible to all users.

Engineer Insightful Shiny Apps with Behavioral Science\n**Code:** PAR-020\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nOpening a Shiny app to endless dropdowns and scattered filters leads to immediate disengagement and feeling like \"death by dropdown\". This talk introduces the Behavioral Insights Design (BID) Framework, a behavioral science roadmap that transforms overwhelming dashboards into guided user journeys. Using the \"Interfaces Need A Smart Vision\" mnemonic, we'll explore five stages: Interpret user needs through data storytelling, Notice cognitive friction points, Anticipate user behavior, Structure the application, and Validate & empower users. Drawing from established theories and real-world production examples, attendees will see how applying behavioral science can dramatically reduce the time between \"Where do I even start?\" and \"Aha, now I get it!\". You'll leave with practical techniques using the new {bidux} package to help transform user confusion into confident exploration and build dashboards that guide users toward better decisions (and fewer ghosted users).\n\n**Speaker name:** Jeremy Winget, PhD\n**Job title:** Full-Stack Engineer\n**Company:** CrossStack Society\n**Bio:**\nJeremy Winget, PhD, is a full-stack engineer and computational social scientist with deep expertise in group dynamics and agent-based modeling.

The same issues exist in Shiny apps, where function often outweighs experience. But as a Shiny developer, you are the door designer, and it’s your responsibility to create user-friendly tools. Not to worry—good design isn’t just for designers. You don’t need an art degree to build intuitive, visually appealing apps. This talk covers composition, color theory, scale, and proportion—practical rules to improve usability. We’ll show real-world examples and code-based strategies to bring these principles to life. Because good design isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.\n\n**Speaker name:** Casey Aguilar-Gervase\n**Job title:** Senior Developer\n**Company:** Atorus Research\n**Bio:**\nCasey Aguilar-Gervase is a Senior Developer at Atorus Research, where she builds and reimagines Shiny applications with a focus on clean design and effortless user experience.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops by setting `status_ignore_workshops` to TRUE. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/).

Learn how to use this package to speed up your existing dplyr codes with little to no changes, and how to work with larger-than-memory data using a syntax that not only feels like dplyr for data frames, but behaves exactly like that.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kirill Müller\n**Job title:** Partner\n**Company:** cynkra GmbH\n**Bio:**\nKirill has been working on the boundary between data and computer science for more than 25 years and is co-founder and partner at cynkra, a Zurich-based data science consultancy.\n\n## Title: Semantic Search for the Rest of Us with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSemantic search matches a search query against documents not just by directly matching words, but by ranking results using semantic meaning  - for example searching for “cat” could also turn up documents that have “tiger.” \n<br><br>\nWhile many enterprise level solutions exist for semantic search, I will show a low memory  technique in Python that enables live semantic search for small to medium document collections that need to be deployed in constrained memory/ CPU environments - such as Posit Connect Cloud or a small cloud server.\n<br><br>\nI will show how a web app (such as Shiny for Python) using just a few hundred megabytes of memory can enable live search using the fixed array support in DuckDB, and the open source library LlamaCPP.\n\n**Speaker name:** Marcos Huerta\n**Job title:** Manager, Data Science\n**Company:** Carmax\n**Bio:**\nMarcos Huerta is a Data Science Manager at Carmax in Richmond, Virginia where he works on pricing algorithms for the Core Pricing Systems team.

He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager - Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager. His current focus is on Posit Connect Cloud, a new online publishing platform for data applications and documents.

Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.

              "response": "The submission specifically mentions a session related to \"ellmer\" titled \"Putting an {ellmer} AI in production with the blessing of IT,\" which matches exactly one of the sessions listed in the criterion. The submission provides detailed information about the session's timing, location, format (Lightning Talks), speakers, and a session code (TALK-1231). It also offers a link to the session catalog for further verification. \n\nThe criterion lists two sessions: \"Programming with LLM APIs: A Beginner’s Guide in R and Python\" and \"Putting an {ellmer} AI in production with the blessing of IT.\" The submission only addresses the second session related to \"ellmer\" and does not mention the first session about LLM APIs. However, the task was to find sessions on \"ellmer,\" and the submission correctly identifies the relevant session on \"ellmer.\"\n\nSince the criterion includes two sessions but the task and submission focus on sessions related to \"ellmer,\" and the submission correctly identifies the relevant \"ellmer\" session, the submission meets the criterion as it pertains to the \"ellmer\" session.\n\nGRADE: C",

Learn how to use this package to speed up your existing dplyr codes with little to no changes, and how to work with larger-than-memory data using a syntax that not only feels like dplyr for data frames, but behaves exactly like that.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kirill Müller\n**Job title:** Partner\n**Company:** cynkra GmbH\n**Bio:**\nKirill has been working on the boundary between data and computer science for more than 25 years and is co-founder and partner at cynkra, a Zurich-based data science consultancy.\n\n## Title: Semantic Search for the Rest of Us with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSemantic search matches a search query against documents not just by directly matching words, but by ranking results using semantic meaning  - for example searching for “cat” could also turn up documents that have “tiger.” \n<br><br>\nWhile many enterprise level solutions exist for semantic search, I will show a low memory  technique in Python that enables live semantic search for small to medium document collections that need to be deployed in constrained memory/ CPU environments - such as Posit Connect Cloud or a small cloud server.\n<br><br>\nI will show how a web app (such as Shiny for Python) using just a few hundred megabytes of memory can enable live search using the fixed array support in DuckDB, and the open source library LlamaCPP.\n\n**Speaker name:** Marcos Huerta\n**Job title:** Manager, Data Science\n**Company:** Carmax\n**Bio:**\nMarcos Huerta is a Data Science Manager at Carmax in Richmond, Virginia where he works on pricing algorithms for the Core Pricing Systems team. He started working in data science in 2019 after completing the Data Incubator data science boot camp. Prior to his data science career, Marcos worked in science policy in Washington DC area, most recently for the U.S. Department of Energy. He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager - Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager. His current focus is on Posit Connect Cloud, a new online publishing platform for data applications and documents. Prior to joining Posit, Alex lived in Amsterdam, NL where he worked for an online travel startup and an education insights company. \n\n## Title: Get your ducks in a row... faster Shiny apps with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nOur small team tackled sluggish Shiny applications by implementing DuckDB as a cache layer, transforming slow, resource-intensive operations into responsive user experiences. Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements.

Learn how to use this package to speed up your existing dplyr codes with little to no changes, and how to work with larger-than-memory data using a syntax that not only feels like dplyr for data frames, but behaves exactly like that.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kirill Müller\n**Job title:** Partner\n**Company:** cynkra GmbH\n**Bio:**\nKirill has been working on the boundary between data and computer science for more than 25 years and is co-founder and partner at cynkra, a Zurich-based data science consultancy.\n\n## Title: Semantic Search for the Rest of Us with DuckDB\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nSemantic search matches a search query against documents not just by directly matching words, but by ranking results using semantic meaning  - for example searching for “cat” could also turn up documents that have “tiger.” \n<br><br>\nWhile many enterprise level solutions exist for semantic search, I will show a low memory  technique in Python that enables live semantic search for small to medium document collections that need to be deployed in constrained memory/ CPU environments - such as Posit Connect Cloud or a small cloud server.\n<br><br>\nI will show how a web app (such as Shiny for Python) using just a few hundred megabytes of memory can enable live search using the fixed array support in DuckDB, and the open source library LlamaCPP.\n\n**Speaker name:** Marcos Huerta\n**Job title:** Manager, Data Science\n**Company:** Carmax\n**Bio:**\nMarcos Huerta is a Data Science Manager at Carmax in Richmond, Virginia where he works on pricing algorithms for the Core Pricing Systems team.

He received a PhD in Astrophysics from Rice University and his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n## Title: Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications\n**Code:** PAR-007\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBuilding cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.\n\n**Speaker name:** Alex Chisholm\n**Job title:** Product Manager - Cloud Platforms\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nAlex Chisholm is a data professional turned product manager. His current focus is on Posit Connect Cloud, a new online publishing platform for data applications and documents.

Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Albino Hegeman\n**Job title:** Data Analyst\n**Company:** NYS OGS\n**Bio:**\nI am a data manager and geospatial analyst with 20+ years of experience.
