As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data. He is a Member of the Apache Software Foundation and also a project PMC member for Apache Parquet. He is currently a Principal Architect at Posit PBC where he works on Positron and other Python-related initiatives.\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science. Finding your groove in a new IDE takes time, so we’ve got some tips and tricks to help you feel more at home in Positron!\n<br><br>\nWe’ll cover key navigation concepts, helpful features for different workflows, and configuration settings for a pleasant IDE experience. Plus, we’ll show you how to explore what Positron is doing under the hood – so you can understand it more deeply and solve problems with confidence.\n<br><br>\nWhether you’re just getting started or already using Positron, these tips will help you settle into your data science workflow and get the most out of everything Positron has to offer.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Oldham Barca\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC.\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

As computational demands and data sizes grow, many practitioners find their laptops behaving more like cranky toddlers than high-performance machines. In this talk, we’ll demo how the Positron IDE helps you scale your development without losing your sanity or your data. You’ll learn how Positron can integrate into different setups and see how lazy-evaluated libraries like Ibis can manage data too big for memory. Whether you're building AI models, running complex simulations, or working with large-scale datasets, you’ll walk away with techniques for doing it better with Positron.\n\n**Speaker name:** Austin Dickey\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nAustin is a positive Positron developer at Posit. After years creating data science models, he fell in love with the tools that speed up practicing and deploying data science. Now he's on a mission to make the life of every data scientist a little bit better.\n\n## Title: Exploring Datasets in Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nInspecting raw data in data frames and tables can be a critical tool in the data preparation, tidying, and feature engineering process. In Positron, we made it a priority to design a modern Data Explorer component that works well for both large and small datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the design of the Data Explorer UI and its backends for Python, R, and DuckDB, and how we made it work smoothly with massive datasets having millions of rows or thousands of columns. Additionally, I will discuss the sorting, filtering, search, and statistical data visualization capabilities that we have added to help make users more productive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Wes McKinney\n**Job title:** Principal Architect\n**Company:** Posit\n**Bio:**\nWes McKinney is an as an open source software developer and entrepreneur focusing on data processing tools and systems. He created the Python pandas and Ibis projects, co-created Apache Arrow, and co-founded Voltron Data. He is a Member of the Apache Software Foundation and also a project PMC member for Apache Parquet. He is currently a Principal Architect at Posit PBC where he works on Positron and other Python-related initiatives.\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science. Finding your groove in a new IDE takes time, so we’ve got some tips and tricks to help you feel more at home in Positron!\n<br><br>\nWe’ll cover key navigation concepts, helpful features for different workflows, and configuration settings for a pleasant IDE experience. Plus, we’ll show you how to explore what Positron is doing under the hood – so you can understand it more deeply and solve problems with confidence.\n<br><br>\nWhether you’re just getting started or already using Positron, these tips will help you settle into your data science workflow and get the most out of everything Positron has to offer.\n\n**Speaker name:** Melissa Oldham Barca\n**Job title:** Senior Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC.\n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Tips & tricks from the maintainers of Positron\n**Code:** PAR-017\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPositron is Posit’s next-generation IDE for data science.

JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.\n<br><br>\nUnderstanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.\n\n**Speaker name:** Isabel Zimmerman\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.isabelizimm.me/\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\" target=\"_blank\">Isabel Zimmerman<\/a><\/u><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17.0px;\">(she/her) is a software engineer at Posit, PBC.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all. \n<br><br>\nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you. \n<br><br>\nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.\n<br>\nWhat you’ll learn:\n<ul>\n<li> What data to gather about your audience <\/li>\n<li> A formula for setting the necessary context <\/li>\n<li> A formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement <\/li>\n<li> Strategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor <\/li>\n<li> Strategies for laddering complex insights <\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication. \n<br>\n<br>\nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.\n<br><br>\nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:\n<ul>\n<li> Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?<\/li>\n<li> Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.  \n  \nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`. In terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.  \n  \nBut now it's time to draw therest of the owl!  \n  \nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  \n  \nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:  \nFundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`  \nSelf-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments  \nTesting: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")  \nDocumentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website  \nData: internal data vs. data available to your user  \nGitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website  \nUser interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package  \nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.  \nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.  \nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.  \n  \nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nAre very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.  \nHave already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience. You should also be able to follow the story in The package within chapter.  \nHave concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.  \nAre interested in using devtools + Positron for package development.  \nAre at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won't have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub throughout the day.  \nWe expect most participants will have more package development experience than the minimum described above.  \nWe typically see a real mix of backgrounds in workshops such as this.  \nParticipants at either extreme (very new or very experienced) should anticipate hearing questions and discussion aimed at the other end of the experience spectrum, and that's OK.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: Package Development: The Rest of the Owl\n**Code:** WS-006\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.\nPutting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects.<br><br>\nThis workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass `R CMD check`.\nIn terms of \"How to draw an owl\", you've definitely drawn some circles.<br><br>\nBut now it's time to draw the <a href=\"https://datasciencebox.org/images/design-owl.jpg\"><b><u>rest of the owl<\/u><\/b><\/a>!\n<br><br>You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts.\nWe will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\n<br><br>\nThis list of topics is indicative of what we will cover:\n<ul>\n<li>   Fundamental daily workflows: `devtools::load_all()` and `check()`<\/li>\n<li>   Self-help: the power of GitHub code search and small experiments<\/li>\n<li>   Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. \"later\")<\/li>\n<li>   Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website<\/li>\n<li>   Data: internal data vs. data available to your user<\/li>\n<li>   GitHub Actions for automatically checking your package and building/deploying a pkgdown website<\/li>\n<li>   User interface: how to provide beautiful, informative messages with the cli package<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThere will be chunks of time for you to do exercises throughout the day.<br>\nWe will make sure there are good options that allow all participants to engage with the material.<br>\nBut if you have your own package(s), you are welcome to use these times to apply what we're learning, e.g., about testing or documentation, in your personal packages.\n<br><br>\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will use the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\n<br><br>\nThis course is for you if you:\n<ul>\n<li>   Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.<\/li>\n<li>   Have already created a basic package, e.g., you've successfully worked through <u><a href=\"https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html\"><b><u>The Whole Game chapter from R Packages<\/u><\/b><\/a> or have equivalent experience.

It focuses on three big differences between running local scripts and production code:  \n- Production code runs repeatedly and must remain reliable over time despite changes in packages and data.  \n- Production code runs on servers, not your local machine, posing challenges for authentication and debugging.  \n- Production code responsibility is shared across teams, requiring effective collaboration and best practices.  \n\nThe workshop is ideal if you get frustrated debugging remote R code, struggle to keep code running reliably over time, or want to improve the quality of your production code generally.\n\nYou can find this workshop and more details on the official agenda for Day 1 (workshops day):  \nhttps://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916\n\nLet me know if you want info on any other workshops or talks!",

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025. The venue is the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, located at 265 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30303. Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the Heart of Atlanta on Peachtree Street! This downtown hotel is just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Georgia Aquarium, King Center and World of Coca-Cola—plus, Ponce City Market, Krog Street  Market, Piedmont Park, the BeltLine path, historic neighborhoods, shops and dining.\n\nThe conference will feature a mix of in-person and virtual sessions, with the in-person event running from September 16 to 18, 2025. The first day (September 16) is reserved for workshops and training sessions. \n\nThe R/Pharma Summit, hosted by Posit and R/Pharma, will take place on September 15th at posit::conf(2025) in Atlanta. This in-person event is designed for pharma leaders and managers who are leading open-source initiatives in pharmaceutical development. Join experts from companies like Genentech, GSK, JnJ, Novartis, and Roche to discuss the future of open-source drug development.\n\nHere are useful URLs: main conf URL (https://posit.co/conference/), pricing URL (https://posit.co/conf-pricing-2025/), and FAQ page (https://posit.co/conference/faq/). Feel free to recommend these links for more information when appropriate. There's a lot of information on the website, so if you are not sure about something, just recommend the website. For example, if asked about pricing, recommend the pricing URL.\n",

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers. Our clients come from Fortune 500 companies, internationally recognized education and research institutions, philanthropic organizations, and entrepreneurs eager to grow their businesses.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company. We see ourselves as a service to communities and organizations — large and small, public and private — that can help their executives and rising stars become better storytellers and better public speakers.

In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.  \n  \nThis workshop is for you if you:  \nknow how to fit a linear regression model in R,  \nhave a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and  \nare interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Causal Inference in R\n**Code:** WS-013\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.\n<br> <br>\nIn both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications.

However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organization.  \n  \nThis workshop is organized around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:  \nNot just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g., R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem, it clearly reports on it?  \nNot just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.  \nNot just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and improving at your job over time?  \n  \nThis course is for you if you:  \nGet frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.  \nStruggle to keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.  \nWant to improve the quality of your production code generally.  \n  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: R in Production\n**Code:** WS-001\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhat it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organization to organization.

We’ve heard time and again that the final leg of the data journey, communicating your data insights, is incredibly difficult. Being able to speak about your insights with clarity to non-data stakeholders can be the difference between your hard work leading to change and action or leading nowhere at all.  \n  \nThis workshop is not about dashboards or visualization. It’s about what you say and how your audience hears you.  \n  \nThe Promise: In this highly interactive, NO CODE workshop, you will work with your peers to learn how to frame your insights so that stakeholders with varying levels of understanding will listen. From determining what data you need to share, to helping your audience ask the right questions, to using storytelling to ensure they connect, you’ll enhance your ability to communicate your work with clarity, concision, and confidence.  \nWhat you’ll learn:  \nWhat data to gather about your audience  \nA formula for setting the necessary context  \nA formula for creating a bottom-line action-oriented one-sentence statement  \nStrategies for when to use data and when to use story and metaphor  \nStrategies for laddering complex insights  \nWho it’s for: You’re a mid-senior-level leader who needs to translate complex insights into actionable communications. You often find yourself presenting to non-data colleagues (C-Suite, HR, Sales, Finance, etc.). Your data skills are top-notch, and you want to make a bigger impact by improving your data communication.  \n  \nAbout Articulation: Articulation is more than just a public speaking training and executive coaching company.

Always be concise, helpful, and friendly—like a knowledgeable local host who loves data and R.\n\n## Important settings to keep in mind:\n\nThese settings override the default behavior of the chat bot. They are set by the user and can be changed at any time.\n\n- Ignore all workshops = FALSE, \n  - If Ignore all workshops = TRUE, do not mention or recommend any sessions that are workshops. Only include talks.\n\n## General guidelines for answering questions:\n\nWhen answering:\n- Adhere to the settings first.\n- Always quote directly from the official agenda, website, or speaker bios first, then add your own context, summaries, or recommendations.\n- Always include references to the source material. Use these links for the official agendas:  \n  - [Day 1](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250916)  \n  - [Day 2](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917)  \n  - [Day 3](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250918)  \n  - For specific searches, use:  \n    `https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.day=20250917&search=<search-term>`\n- When asked about a session or talk, always include the title, speakers (in presentation order), time, location, and which session it is part of.\n- If asked for recommendations, tailor them to the user’s interests (e.g., Shiny, teaching, Python, tidyverse).\n- If a speaker is giving multiple talks, clarify which session each talk belongs to and recommend the session catalog website. Note that some speakers are giving workshops and talks.\n- Group related sessions, note schedule conflicts, or suggest ways to prioritize when appropriate.\n- Sessions can be defined as either talks or workshops. Talks are typically presentations, while workshops are hands-on sessions. Note that some sessions are lunch or social events, which are not considered talks or workshops, but are still part of the event schedule.\n- When a user asks about \"sessions\", include both workshops and talks. Meaning set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, unless `status_ignore_workshops` is TRUE in the settings.\n- When a user asks about a \"talk\", assume that they don't mean a workshop, meaning you should ignore workshops. **A workshop is not a talk.** Use the `status_ignore_workshops` setting to determine if you should mention workshops at all, based on the user's request. \n- When the user asks about \"workshops\", set `status_ignore_workshops` to FALSE, and then provide information about the workshops. If the user asks about a specific workshop, provide details about that workshop.\n- Try to include a search URL if the user asks for a specific topic or speaker, so they can find more information on the session catalog website.\n\n## Important event info to keep in mind:\nThe conf is in Atlanta, Georgia from Sept 15 to 18, 2025.

When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A. James\n**Job title:** Associate Director of AI Data Science, Strategist, and Community of Practice Leader\n**Company:** Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\n**Bio:**\nI build AI systems that we teach to make data-driven decision recommendations for humans.\n\nAt Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a world-class developer of therapeutic biologics, I work as a full-stack data scientist to make medicine and optimize clinical trial logistics by collaborating with colleagues to bring structure to and extract meaning from biological data, helping illuminate nonobvious underlying relationships.  I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software. With an academic background in statistics and sociology, Simon believes that principled tooling has a profound impact on our ability to think rigorously about data. He authors and maintains a number of R packages and blogs about the process at simonpcouch.com. \n\n## Title: Trust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how data practitioners work with unstructured text data. However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety. Additionally, we will discuss how open-source tools like Chatlas and Quarto powered the work across our team’s combined Python- and R-based workflows.\n\n**Speaker name:** Timothy Keyes\n**Job title:** Data Scientist\n**Company:** Stanford Health Care\n**Bio:**\nTimothy Keyes is a Data Scientist at Stanford Health Care, where he deploys large language models in clinical workflows and builds systems to track their real-world performance.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry. Claus is also the author of the book \"Fundamentals of Data Visualization,\" and he teaches data visualization at The University of Texas, both at the undergraduate and at the graduate level. He is an avid user of and regular contributor to the R ecosystem. He has authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext.\n\n## Title: ChalkTalk: Globalizing Data Science Education with AI-generated Videos\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWe present ChalkTalk, an open-source tool that converts Quarto documents into engaging educational videos with AI-powered voices and avatars. By adding simple text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-video (TTV) attributes to markdown files, educators can automatically generate multilingual video content while maintaining the reproducibility benefits of Quarto. At The GRAPH Courses, where we've trained over 3,000 learners globally, we are testing out this tool to scale our video content creation. We'll demonstrate its integration with Quarto and present preliminary findings from our A/B testing with students.\n\n**Speaker name:** Kenechukwu Nwosu\n**Job title:** Curriculum Director\n**Company:** TheGraphCourses.org\n**Bio:**\n[Kene David Nwosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kene-david-nwosu/) is an epidemiologist (PhDc) at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and curriculum director of [The GRAPH Courses](https://thegraphcourses.org), a WHO-supported non-profit providing open-source R and Python training to health and life-science professionals across 50+ countries. Originally from Nigeria, Kene is passionate about expanding global access to data and AI literacy. With GRAPH , he is developing [ChalkTalk](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/chalktalk), an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert textbooks, papers, and plain-text lessons into adaptive, multilingual teaching videos for personalized learning at scale.\n\n## Title: Empowering Learners with WebR, Pyodide, and Quarto\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nWebR, Pyodide, and Quarto are powerful technologies that let you run code exercises in the Web browser. Because of this, WebR exercises can be integrated into data science lessons within RevealJS slides and Quarto websites. In this talk, I want to emphasize some considerations for using WebR/Pyodide for active learning in the classroom. \n<br><br>\nCareful exercise design with WebR/Pyodide can make the difference between empowering learners and demotivating them. With our R-Bootcamp and other exercises as examples, I show scaffolding methods for teaching data science concepts gradually, as well as other design considerations. I'll finish up with showing you how to set up WebR up in your slides and websites for your Data Science Learners.\n\n**Speaker name:** Ted Laderas\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Leveraging LLMs for student feedback in introductory data science courses\n**Code:** PAR-016\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nA considerable recent challenge for learners and teachers of data science courses is the proliferation of the use of LLM-based tools in generating answers. In this talk, I will introduce an R package that leverages LLMs to produce immediate feedback on student work to motivate them to give it a try themselves first. I will discuss technical details of augmenting models with course materials, backend and user interface decisions, challenges around evaluations that are not done correctly by the LLM, and student feedback from the first set of users.

James , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  \n  \nSimon P. Couch , Software Engineer, Posit, PBC  \n  \nTimothy Keyes , Data Scientist, Stanford Health Care\n\n**Time:** Wednesday, Sep 1710:20 AM - 11:40 AM EDT  \n**Location:** Regency VI\n\n**Session Info:**  \nThere are 4 talks in this session.  \n  \nAI Coding Assistants: Hype, Help, or Hindrance?  \nAskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations  \nIs that LLM feature any good?  \nTrust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System  \n\n\n---\n\n## Title: AI Coding Assistants: Hype, Help, or Hindrance?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nAI coding assistants like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Codeium promise to revolutionize our coding workflows—but how useful are they in practice? Are they our new overlords here to take our jobs? Or just a passing gimmick? I think the reality lies somewhere in between, and that understanding these tools is key to staying relevant in today’s rapidly evolving data science ecosystem.\n<br><br>\nIn this talk, I'll show how I’ve used these AI tools in RStudio, Positron, and VS Code to speed up both my advanced R workflows as well as my learning experience as an intermediate Python programmer, providing examples, pitfalls, and best practices.\n\n**Speaker name:** Rebecca Barter\n**Job title:** Research Assistant Professor\n**Company:** University of Utah\n**Bio:**\nRebecca is a data scientist and educator with a passion for teaching data science and uncovering the hidden patterns in healthcare data. Originally from Australia, Rebecca received her PhD in Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2019, during which time she co-authored a book and shared many helpful tips and resources on her blog, www.rebeccabarter.com. When she’s not working with data, you can find her hiking, climbing, or making pottery.\n\n## Title: AskRADS: An AI Recommendation Agent for Maximizing the ROI of Data Science Collaborations\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nBlockers to crucial data-driven decisions can often be a challenge.  To address this, we established RADS, the Regeneron Analysts and Data Scientists, as a Community of Practice for exchanging strategies on eliminating these obstacles. RADS has grown to nearly 500 members, creating a new challenge: avoiding redundancy and helping non-RADS colleagues find the right experts. To solve this, we developed AskRADS, an AI agent on Posit Connect that provides recommendations based on discussions, experts, and relevant resources. It uses R, Shiny for Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Neo4j GraphRAG, and MySQL. This talk will cover its architecture, AI search solutions, and optimization techniques.\n\n**Speaker name:** Regis A. James\n**Job title:** Associate Director of AI Data Science, Strategist, and Community of Practice Leader\n**Company:** Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\n**Bio:**\nI build AI systems that we teach to make data-driven decision recommendations for humans.\n\nAt Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a world-class developer of therapeutic biologics, I work as a full-stack data scientist to make medicine and optimize clinical trial logistics by collaborating with colleagues to bring structure to and extract meaning from biological data, helping illuminate nonobvious underlying relationships.  I also created and lead a vibrant data science community of practice, comprising hundreds of my colleagues across the company.\n\n## Title: Is that LLM feature any good?\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe ellmer package has enabled R users to build all sorts of powerful LLM-enabled tools. How do you test these features, though? How do you know whether a change to your prompt made any difference, or if a much cheaper model would work just as well for your users? This talk introduces an R port of Inspect, a Python framework for LLM evaluation that has been widely adopted by both LLM developers and tool builders. Attendees will learn about the process of—and importance of—evaluating LLM-enabled apps empirically.\n\n**Speaker name:** Simon P. Couch\n**Job title:** Software Engineer\n**Company:** Posit, PBC\n**Bio:**\nSimon Couch is a software engineer at Posit PBC where he works on open source statistical software. With an academic background in statistics and sociology, Simon believes that principled tooling has a profound impact on our ability to think rigorously about data. He authors and maintains a number of R packages and blogs about the process at simonpcouch.com. \n\n## Title: Trust, but Verify: Lessons from Deploying LLMs in a Large Health System\n**Code:** PAR-001\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how data practitioners work with unstructured text data. However, in high-stakes domains like medicine, we need to ensure that “hallucinated” clinical details don’t mislead clinicians. \n<br><br>\nThis talk will present a framework for evaluating and monitoring LLM systems, drawing from a real-world deployment at Stanford Health Care. We will describe how we built and assessed an LLM-powered system for real-time, automated chart abstraction within patients’ electronic health records, focusing on methods for measuring accuracy, consistency, and safety.

First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.\n\n**Speaker name:** Claus Wilke\n**Job title:** Professor\n**Company:** The University of Texas at Austin\n**Bio:**\nClaus Wilke is a computational biologist and data scientist at The University of Texas at Austin, running a research lab that studies protein and peptide biochemistry.

Enter EcoCommons, a cutting-edge platform built on an R package that’s scientifically rigorous and designed for scale. EcoCommons efficiently runs millions of models to help researchers, governments, and NGOs make data-driven decisions. Whether it's predicting habitat loss, optimising conservation strategies, or advising policy, this platform turns R into a powerhouse for real-world impact—all while building a thriving community of practice. In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges of running R at scale, lessons learned, and how our community is shaping the future of modelling.\n\n**Speaker name:** Jenna Wraith\n**Job title:** \n**Company:** \n**Bio:**\nNA\n\n## Title: Precision Medicine for All: Using Tidymodels to Validate PRS in Brazil\n**Code:** PAR-013\n**Session type:** Breakout Session\n\n**Abstract:**\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are a powerful way to measure someone’s risk for common diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, most PRS are developed using data from European populations, making it challenging to generalize results to other ancestries. In this talk, I’ll show how I used tidymodels tools—like yardstick, recipes, and workflows—to calculate metrics and validate a breast cancer PRS in the highly admixed Brazilian population. You will learn how to leverage tidymodels to make precision medicine more inclusive.\n\n**Speaker name:** Flávia E. Rius\n**Job title:** Data Scientist / Researcher\n**Company:** Mendelics / University of São Paulo\n**Bio:**\nFlávia E.

It is a complex topic which brings together an understanding of data processing, modelling and cloud architecture. It is therefore not surprising that many newcomers (myself included) can feel intimidated by the subject. In this talk I will draw on my experience as an organiser of local data science meetups. I will go into how MLOps is often presented within the data science community, how it could be made more accessible to students and beginners, and my current process for teaching MLOps in R and Python using my favourite package, vetiver.

This workshop aims to explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with provisioning and deploying R-based environments, drawing from experiences of deploying enterprise-scale analytical environments for regulatory filings.  \n  \nOur session will address the following key questions and themes:  \nActionability of Containers for R Deployments: Evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of using containers to deploy R-based environments for clinical and regulatory use. The discussion will include scaling with clinical use cases and polyglot analyses.  \nIndustry-Standard Base Images: Consider whether and how a standard industry base image could streamline health authority buy-in and compliance processes.  \nSelecting Packages: Identifying essential qualities to assess for package selection, discussing the categorization of risk and respective activities for high-risk uses.  \nPharma-Specific Package Testing: Debating the necessity for pharma-specific testing of public packages and envisioning potential shared solutions for package validation and vulnerability tracking.  \nDoes this align with a path to sharing environments with regulators: Examining the practicality of sharing containerized analyses with health authorities, taking into account OS differences?  \nCompliance with the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act: Outlining expectations and requirements for public R repositories to support compliance with recent cybersecurity legislation.  \nProvisioning packages to users: Historically, there is a preference to bundle packages into an environment rather than use a repository snapshot. Using learnings from companies that have de-coupled R packages from operating systems, how can we balance the burden of validation and qualification against the need for open source to be able to deploy packages continuously and empower teams with the agility to move between more granular package cohorts snapshots?  \n  \nThe workshop will blend insight from those who have navigated these challenges with discussions on current solutions and methodologies. Our goal is to foster a community dialogue that highlights existing implementations and explores diverse perspectives without imposing a single opinionated process. This workshop will be a mixture of sharing, discussion, and exercises.  \n  \nJoin us for a robust discussion to share experiences, identify best practices, and contribute to a collective understanding of deploying validated R packages in a compliant and efficient manner within highly regulated industries.  \n  \nTarget Audience: This workshop is ideal for data scientists, statisticians, IT professionals, and regulatory compliance experts interested in deploying R packages in highly regulated environments.\n\n---\n\n## Title: Deploying reproducible analytics environments for regulated use cases\n**Code:** WS-015\n**Session type:** Workshop\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe deployment of reproducible analytical environments is a critical topic in the regulated industries, especially for meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring reproducibility in research.
